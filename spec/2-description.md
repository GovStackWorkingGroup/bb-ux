  Design standards, guidance and patterns for designing services using GovStack
  building blocks.

# Description

## Introduction

The UI/UX working group has developed this guidance to kick-start the design and development of services using the GovStack building blocks.

This guidance supports teams identify and implement the foundations for designing user-centred, accessible, consistent and technically robust services.

This guidance is intended to help teams align to the [GovStack Design Principles](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/govstack-design-principles) and the [Implementation Playbook](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/).

## Current scope

Specifications for how to implement accessible, responsive, multi-modal building blocks and providing a consistent service.

* Guidelines for designing interfaces, like meeting WCAG accessibility guidelines
* Screen flows for common user journeys, like registration
* Guidance on technical choices, like how to design for low bandwidth, high latency environments or unreliable connectivity, local storage and local persistence of data, security using DOMs etc
* patterns for managing client-side validation

### Service design standards

The standards act as a template checklist for assuring the quality of a service's design and delivery. Each point in the standard has, or links to additional guidance.

### Service patterns

We chose to define high-level service patterns rather than anything more specific like a design system or user interface components, this is to maintain flexibility to work around each organisation's needs and existing design assets and front-end frameworks.

## Out of scope

Developing tools for implementing design patterns like:

* design systems
* user interface components or code
* styleguides
