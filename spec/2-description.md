  Design standards, guidance and patterns for designing services using GovStack
  building blocks.

# Description

## Introduction

The UI/UX working group has developed this guidance to kick-start the design and development of services using the GovStack building blocks.

This guidance supports teams identify and implement the foundations for designing user-centred, accessible, consistent and technically robust services.

This guidance is intended to help teams align to the [GovStack Design Principles](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/govstack-design-principles) and the [Implementation Playbook](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/).

## Current scope

Specifications for how to implement accessible, responsive, multi-modal building blocks and providing a consistent service.

* Guidelines for designing interfaces, like meeting WCAG accessibility guidelines
* Screen flows for common user journeys, like registration
* Guidance on technical choices, like how to design for low bandwidth, high latency environments or unreliable connectivity
* patterns for managing client-side validation

### Service design standards

The standards act as a template checklist for assuring the quality of a service's design and delivery. Each point in the standard has, or links to additional guidance.

### Service patterns

We chose to define high-level service patterns rather than anything more specific like a design system or user interface components, this is to maintain flexibility to work around each organisation's needs and existing design assets and front-end frameworks.

## Out of scope

Developing tools for implementing design patterns like:

* design systems
* user interface components or code
* styleguides

## Get involved

We are looking for practitioners from around the world to give feedback and critique to our work or input directly. Most people involved are using time volunteered by their place of work.
