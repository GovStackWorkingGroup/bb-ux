# Get started using patterns



**Considerations for choosing different patterns**

**Step by step guide to help you pick the right patterns for your service:**&#x20;

* Get clear on the service you want to deliver. Start by understanding the purpose and goals of your service. Define the problem you are trying to solve and the value you aim to provide to your users. Refer to the [user journey guidance in the GovStack implementation playbook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/govstack-implementation-playbook/design-and-delivery/user-journeys) to help you identify the key touch points and interactions involved in your service.
* Understand the user flows or phases of your service journey: Break down the user journey into distinct phases or user flows. This could include registration, asking users for further information, booking appointments, providing feedback, and messaging. Identify the sequence of steps and interactions that users will go through during each flow. [Consider the technology choices available to you. ](../service-design-standards/technology-choices.md)
* Determine the patterns needed: Based on the user flows and phases identified, determine the patterns (user-focused tasks and page types) that are required. For example, registration may require a sign-up pattern, while asking for further information could involve a question pages pattern. Consider how these patterns will align with the specific needs and goals of each user flow.
* Identify the components needed: Patterns are typically composed of one or more components. For common user-focused tasks, start by looking at existing patterns first. If there are unique or specific requirements for a certain context for your service, you may need to use one or more individual components

**Choosing patterns when you are using the GovStack building block approach.**&#x20;

If you are using the GovStack Building Blocks approach consider the common use cases, user journeys, user flows, patterns, and components that you need. Check the list on [service patterns.](service-patterns/) &#x20;
