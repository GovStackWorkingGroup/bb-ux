# User centred design

#### Things You Must Do:

* Start by thoroughly understanding the needs and requirements of the solution, including user needs, expectations, and pain points.
* Begin with the patterns provided with the building blocks, unless research clearly indicates a need to diverge from them.
* Conduct user testing with real people and gather feedback at various stages of the design process to identify usability issues, user preferences, and opportunities for improvement.
* Use user feedback to inform iterative design and continuously improve the digital government service, making necessary adjustments to meet the evolving needs of users.

#### Considerations:

* Regularly review and update the design of the digital government service based on user feedback, changing needs, and evolving requirements.
* Collaborate closely with users, stakeholders, and other [team members with diverse multidisciplinary skills](https://app.gitbook.com/o/pxmRWOPoaU8fUAbbcrus/s/4D3oEcPGpYoKnwkQmCzJ/govstack-implementation-playbook/sample-digital-team-composition), throughout the iterative design process to ensure alignment and effective communication.
* Seek input and feedback from diverse user groups, including users with disabilities, to ensure that the digital government service is inclusive and accessible to all.
* Continuously monitor and evaluate the performance and usability of the service, and iterate the design accordingly to drive continuous improvement and optimise user experience.
* Share research findings and product progress with team members, senior members or strategic leaders, and even the general public whenever practical.&#x20;
