# 2. Accessibility and inclusion

Accessibility is important because it allows services to give equal access for all citizens, comply with legal requirements, foster inclusivity, enhances user experience, avoids discrimination, and contributes to government credibility, cost savings, innovation, and international reputation.

## Test for accessibility

There could be significant interdependencies between UI components for different accessibility requirements. The world-wide web consortium and Web accessibility initiative have developed standards for  ([WCAG, ATAG, UAAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/#guidelines))  considering the needs of developers, authoring tools, accessibility evaluation tools and guidelines on how to make user-agents(browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers) accessible to users.
