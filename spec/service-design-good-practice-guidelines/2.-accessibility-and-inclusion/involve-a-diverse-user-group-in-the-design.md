# Involve a diverse user group in the design

Involve users with disabilities and users from diverse backgrounds in user testing and feedback gathering to identify any potential accessibility and inclusivity issues.

Address barriers that prevent people from accessing public services across all channels

Acknowledge that a minority of users will always be unable or unwilling to adopt digital public services and consider alternative mechanisms, where appropriate
