# Test for accessibility

Check that the implementation of the building blocks, as well as the overall digital government service, meets the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards for accessibility. \[[WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/)]

Test the service using accessibility tools like screen readers to identify and fix any accessibility issues. \[[How to test for accessibility](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility) ]

Stay informed about any updates or changes to accessibility standards, guidelines, and inclusivity best practices.

Seek expert assistance or consultation on accessibility and inclusivity if needed.
