# Set up analytics

**1. Quick Setup (Google Analytics or Similar):**

These services are relatively easy to set up and can provide robust data about your users' behaviour.

* **Setup:** Start by creating an account on the platform and adding the tracking code to your service. Each page of your website should include this tracking code.
* **Configuration:** Next, set up goals or events within the platform to track specific user actions that correspond to your KPIs.
* **Monitoring:** Once setup is complete, you can monitor user behaviour data through the platform's dashboard.

**2. Medium Setup (Open-Source Analytics Platforms):**

These solutions like Matomo or Plausible offer more control over your data and are often more privacy-focused.

* **Setup:** You'll need to host these platforms on a server, either your own or through a hosting provider. Then, similar to the quick setup, you'll add the tracking code to your website.
* **Configuration:** Define the events or goals you want to track, which should align with your identified KPIs.
* **Monitoring:** Use the platform's dashboard to monitor user behaviour and track your KPIs.

**3. Slow Setup (Hosting Your Own Analytics Tools):**

This is the most complex option, but it gives you the most control over your data. This could involve using a self-hosted platform, or even building your own analytics system.

* **Setup:** This will vary greatly depending on your specific solution. You may need to set up a server, install and configure software, and integrate this with your service.
* **Configuration:** Again, this will depend on your solution, but you'll likely need to manually set up the tracking for each of your KPIs.
* **Monitoring:** Depending on your system, you might need to create your own dashboard or reporting system to monitor your data.

With each option, consider user privacy and comply with all relevant data protection laws. This includes informing users about the data you're collecting, why you're collecting it, and giving them the ability to opt out if they choose.
