# Understand needs and requirements

Start by understanding the needs and requirements of the solution, including users' needs, expectations, and pain points. You can find examples for how to understand user needs in [the implementation playbook.](https://govstack.gitbook.io/implementation-playbook/govstack-implementation-playbook/design-and-delivery/user-journeys)

### **User Research**&#x20;

Understanding user needs begins with user research. This includes techniques like surveys, interviews, user testing, and analysis of usage data. The goal is to understand the tasks users are trying to complete, the problems they face, and their goals and motivations.

### **Question Assumptions**

Always question assumptions about what users need. Just because something is commonly done or seems like a good idea doesn't mean it's what users need. Validate every assumption with data.

### **Frame the Problem**

Before jumping into solutions, make sure you have correctly framed the problem. Ask: What user need is this solving? Why is this a problem for our users? How do we know this?

### **Prioritise Based on User Needs**

Not all user needs are equally important. Use data from your research to prioritise features and improvements based on what users need most.
